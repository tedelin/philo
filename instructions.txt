Create the thread (philo) and store the id
prevent thread to take the same fork if a fork has been taken prevent with a mutex
if fork unavailable -> wait for thread to finish else take the fork and eat
store when a philo start eating
check death : if a philo hasn't start to eat Xms since the beginning of his last meal -> death

philo 1 will take his fork and the fork of NB_PHILO
other will take his fork and the fork of cur_philo - 1

?? loop until a philo died create thread
